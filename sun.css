    <h1> Sun-Earth Simulation
      </h1>
    <p id="p1"> The Sun is by far the largest object in the solar system. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest). It is often said that the Sun is an “ordinary” star. ... This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core.
      </p>
    <p id="p2"> Earth, our home, is the third planet from the sun. It's the only planet known to have an atmosphere containing free oxygen, oceans of water on its surface and, of course, life. Earth is the fifth largest of the planets in the solar system. ... About a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants.
